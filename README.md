# STM32F4 with EmBitz

This repo is a guide to start developing projects with STM32F3 Discovery board and EmBitz IDE.
Using the standart libraries, there ares examples how to configure and use the peripherals in a easy way. Probably this examples could be applied to others ARM microcontrolers.
Enjoy it :)

## Pre-requisites

* Install EmBitz from the official page https://www.embitz.org/
* STM32F4 Discovery board (or other stm32F4 microcontroller)

## Getting Started

### New project

```
If you want, you can just use the StartProject and skip this step
```

File-> New Project -> choose stm32f429zi (the microcontroller used on discovery board).
Make sure you select the standart peripheral library!

### Write on microcontroller

When everything is done, you can click on debug button to compile the code and programing the microncontroller. If is everything ok EmBitz will open a new file (in assembely), ignore it for now. Click on Continue and you will see your code working on.
